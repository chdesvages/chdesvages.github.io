\preface

This monograph began as a set of notes for a series of talks at MSRI in Spring 2020 about the \emph{pyknotic} or \emph{condensed formalism},
which offers a way to coordinate \enquote{continuous} and \enquote{algebraic} or \enquote{derived} structures.

Shortly after the seminar began, however, most of the world went into lockdown in response to the COVID pandemic.
The seminar stumbled along for a short time, but it became increasingly difficult to carry on.
The seminar ended, and our ability to interact mathematically changed dramatically.
