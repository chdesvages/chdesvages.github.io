\mytitle{Absolute schemes in characteristic $p$}

Mike Hill suggested that I try to keep a regular research diary.
It seemed like a good idea.

Here's a basic construction.
If $\Perf$ denotes the category of perfect schemes of characteristic $p$,
then there is an action of the circle $\TT$ on this category,
which on objects is given by the action of $\ZZ$ by the Frobenius $F$.
I want to think about the orbits for this action $\Perf/\TT$.
That's the $2$-category whose objects are perfect schemes in characteristic $p$,
whose $1$-morphisms are morphisms of such,
and whose $2$-morphisms $f \to g$ are integers $m$ such that $g = f F^m$.
