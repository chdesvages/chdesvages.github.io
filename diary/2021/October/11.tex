\mytitle{Absolute schemes in characteristic $p$}

Mike Hill suggested that I try to keep a regular research diary.
It seemed like a good idea.

Here's a basic construction.
If $\Perf$ denotes the category of perfect schemes of characteristic $p$,
then there is an action of the circle $\TT$ on this category,
which on objects is given by the action of $\ZZ$ by the Frobenius $F$.
I want to think about the orbits for this action $\Perf/\TT$.
That's the $2$-category whose objects are perfect schemes in characteristic $p$,
whose $1$-morphisms are morphisms of such,
and whose $2$-morphisms $f \to g$ are integers $m$ such that $g = f F^m$.

The reason I like this is that the product $X \times Y$ in sheaves%
\sidenote{for the $v$ topology, I guess}
on $\Perf/\TT$ is well-behaved with respect to étale homotopy.
For instance, $\Gal(X\times Y) = \Gal(X) \times \Gal(Y)$,
which doesn't usually happen in characteristic $p$.

This is all very well, but
how should one make sense of the geometry of the objects of $\Sh(\Perf/\TT) = \Sh(\Perf)/\TT$?%
\sidenote{In categories, that's the fixed points, but in topoi, it's the orbits.}
One possibility is to think of it as introducing a homotopy between the identity and the Frobenius,
which is trivial on the stratified homotopy type.
So should one think of the underlying space of $X$ in this category as $X \times S^1$?

On the other hand, one of the things I like about the category $\Sh(\Perf/\TT)$
is that the (stratified) étale homotopy type factors through it.
