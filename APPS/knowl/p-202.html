<p>And in a way, you're right: we'll almost never <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">use</em> this way of formalizing the natural numbers. (And not to worry: the course won't <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">all</em> be like this!) There's a bit of a mismatch here between how we formalize certain pieces of mathematics and how we think about those pieces of mathematics. However: formalization in mathematics has four positive effects:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>It holds us to an extremely high standard of verification. When we reduce all concepts to a small number of primitive ones with a small number of rules for their interaction, then we can be very confident that the things we derive in this way are actually true.</p></li>
<li><p>Being able to encode things in ways similar to this makes it possible to encode these ideas on a computer, and use the computer to verify our proofs. This is a growing part of pure mathematics.</p></li>
<li><p>While this approach to the natural numbers may not be how we start off thinking about them, very often the act of formalization reveals a different and new set of intuitions we can have toward even familiar mathematical objects. In this case, our strategy for defining the natural numbers in this iterative fashion provides us with a blueprint for proving certain kinds of statements â€“ <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">induction</dfn>.</p></li>
<li><p>Lastly, formalization gives us the opportunity to <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">generalize</em> notions in surprising directions. In this case, the way we've defined the natural numbers generalizes to what are called the <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">von Neumann ordinals</dfn>, which permit us to talk about various infinite structures, and even to do an infinite kind of induction, called <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">transfinite induction</dfn>.</p></li>
</ul>
