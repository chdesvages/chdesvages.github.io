<p>Suppose we want to count how many numbers between 1 and 100 are divisible by either 3 or 5. A first attempt might be to say, well, there are \(99/3=33\) numbers divisible by \(3\) and \(100/5=20\) numbers that are divisible by \(5\text{,}\) so the numbers that are divisible by \(3\) or \(5\) is the sum of these two numbers, i.e. \(33+20=53\text{.}\) However, we again run into an <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">overcounting</dfn> problem, since some numbers are divisible both by \(3\) and \(5\) and thus are being counted twice. We can't just divide our answer by 2 as before, since there are plenty of numbers that are divisible by \(3\) but not \(5\) and vice versa. The way to overcome this is by using the <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">inclusion-exclusion principle</dfn>:</p>
