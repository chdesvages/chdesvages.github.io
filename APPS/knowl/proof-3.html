<p>We begin with the forward direction; that is, we shall show first that if \(\neg(\phi \vee \psi)\text{,}\) then \((\neg{\phi}) \wedge (\neg{\psi})\text{.}\) So let us assume \(\neg(\phi \vee \psi)\text{.}\) We aim to prove that both \(\neg{\phi}\) and \(\neg{\psi}\text{.}\)</p>
<p>In other words, we need to show that \(\phi\) is <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">false</dfn>. So we want to prove that \(\phi\) implies something we know to be false. In our case, we are assuming that \(\neg(\phi \vee \psi)\text{,}\) so we know \(\quine{\phi \vee \psi}\) to be false. This is great news: if \(\phi\) is true, then certainly \(\quine{\phi \vee \psi}\) is true. That is, \(\phi \implies (\phi \vee \psi)\text{.}\) Since we know that \(\quine{\phi \vee \psi}\) is false, that implies that \(\phi\) is false as well. Thus \(\quine{\neg{\phi}}\) holds. Similarly, \(\psi \implies (\phi \vee \psi)\text{,}\) but that contradicts our assumption that \(\quine{\neg(\phi \vee \psi)}\) is true. Thus \(\quine{\neg{\psi}}\) holds.</p>
<p>Now let's reverse directions; that is, let's show that if \((\neg{\phi}) \wedge (\neg{\psi})\text{,}\) then \(\neg(\phi \vee \psi)\text{.}\) So let us assume that both \(\neg{\phi}\) and \(\neg{\psi}\text{.}\) We aim to prove that \(\neg(\phi \vee \psi)\text{.}\)</p>
<p>In other words, we need to show that \(\quine{\phi \vee \psi}\) is <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">false</em>. If \(\phi \vee \psi\text{,}\) there are two options:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>One possibility is that \(\phi\) is true. But this would contradict our assumption that \(\quine{\neg{\phi}}\) is true.</p></li>
<li><p>So that leaves the other possibility, which is that \(\psi\) is true. But that contradicts our other assumption, that \(\quine{\neg{\psi}}\) is true.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Either way, we arrive at a contradiction, and so \(\quine{\phi\vee \psi}\) is indeed false.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="proofbycontradiction.html#proof-3">in-context</a></span>
