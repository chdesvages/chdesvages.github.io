<p>In this section we will talk about relations. A relation, loosely speaking, is a way two things are connected to each other, and there are many different ways that things can be related. The relation “=” is an example, two things are related via “=” if they are actually equal. Another example is the relationship that one number is at most another, and we write \(a\leq b\) when we want to say \(a\) and \(b\) are related in this way. A less mathematical example is the relation “daughter of,” so for example “\(a\) is the daughter of \(b\text{,}\)” let's denote this relationship by \(a\sim b\text{.}\)</p>
