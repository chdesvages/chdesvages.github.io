<p>This was an exercise in the chapter on induction, but now we will give a different proof. A first attempt is as follows using the Multiplication Principle. Given two vertices \(v\) and \(w\text{,}\) we will let \(\overline{vw}\) denote the line segment between them. Pick a corner \(v\text{,}\) there are \(n\) options. Then there are \(n-3\) other corners \(w\) that you can pick to form a diagonal \(\overline{vw}\) (since we have to exclude the vertex \(v\) and the two vertices next to it, since connecting to those from \(v\) won't form a diagonal contained in the polygon). Thus, there are \(n(n-3)\) ways of picking a corner \(v\) and then another corner \(w\) so that \(\overline{vw}\) forms a diagonal.</p>
