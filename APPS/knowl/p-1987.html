<p>Another example: again let \(A = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\) and suppose this time we want to partition \(A\) into non-interchangeable sets of sizes \(2, 2\) and \(2\text{.}\) More concretely, suppose we are given a red, a blue and a green bin, and we want to calculate the number of ways of throwing \(2\) elements of \(A\) into the red bin, \(2\) elements of \(A\) into the blue bin and \(2\) elements of \(A\) into the green bin. (In the previous example there was no need to assign colours to the bins because they were always going to hold <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">different</dfn> numbers of members of \(A\) â€” the red bin was always going to hold \(3\) members of \(A\text{,}\) the blue bin \(2\) members and the green bin \(1\) member of \(A\text{.}\)) There are \(6 \choose 2\) ways to throw \(2\) members of \(A\) into the red bin, \(4\choose2\) ways of throwing \(2\) of the remaining \(4\) members of \(A\) into the blue bin, and \(2 \choose 2\) ways of throwing the remaining \(2\) members of \(A\) into the green bin. So altogether there are</p>

\begin{equation*}
{6 \choose 2} \times {4 \choose 2} \times {2 \choose 2}= \frac{6!}{4! 2!} \times \frac{4!}{2! 2!} \times \frac{2!}{2!} = \frac{6!}{2! 2! 2!}
