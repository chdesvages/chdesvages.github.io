<body><div class="solution solution-like"><p>We notice that \(2^{1/n} \geq 1\) for all \(n\) (since this is equivalent to \(2 \geq 1^n = 1\)) and also that \(2^{1/(n+1)} \leq 2^{1/n}\) for all \(n\) (since this is equivalent to \(2^n \leq 2^{n+1}\)). Therefore \((a_n)\) is a decreasing sequence which is bounded below by \(1\text{.}\) Consequently, by the MCT, it converges to some number \(L\) which satisfies \(L\geq1\) (and \(L\lt 2\)). Consider the sequence \(b_n = 2^{1/2n}\text{.}\) It runs through alternate values of \(a_n\text{,}\) and so \(b_n \to L\) also as \(n \to \infty\text{.}\) But \(b_n^2 = a_n\text{,}\) so by the rules for limits we must have \(L^2 = L\text{,}\) or \(L(L-1) =0\text{,}\) meaning either \(L=0\) or \(L=1\text{.}\) Since \(1 \leq L \lt 2\) the only possibility is \(L = 1\text{.}\)</p></div></body>
