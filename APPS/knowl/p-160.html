<p>Why didn't we do the same computations but with the original inequality? If we assumed \(\sqrt{3}\lt  1+\sqrt{2}\text{,}\) then squaring both sides gives</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
3\lt  (1+\sqrt{2})^2=1+2\sqrt{2}+2=3+\sqrt{2}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">which is certainly true, but this doesn't help us. We started by assuming the thing we wanted to prove and then deducing something we know to be true. if \(\phi\) is the statement “\(\sqrt{3}\lt  1+\sqrt{2}\)” and \(\psi\) is the statement “\(3\lt 3+\sqrt{2}\text{,}\)” then what we just showed was \(\phi\implies \psi\text{,}\) but that can't help us conclude that \(\phi\) is true. In our proof of \(\phi\) by contradiction, we assumed first that \(\phi\) is <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">false</dfn>, and then we deduce the statement \(\chi\text{:}\) “\(3&gt;3\text{,}\)” which we know perfectly well is false. Since \(\chi\) is false, the implication \(\neg{\phi} \implies \chi\) ensures that \(\neg{\phi}\) has to be false as well; in other words, \(\phi\) is true.</p>
