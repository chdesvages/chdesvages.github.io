<p>In this exercise we will show that \(x^4 + y^4 = z^4\) (the Fermat quartic) has no <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">nontrivial solutions</dfn>, that is, no integer solutions apart from \((x,y,z)=0\text{.}\) The method we will use is known as “infinite descent”: we suppose there is a solution \((x,y,z)\) with \(z&gt;0\text{,}\) then we assume \((x,y,z)\) has \(z\) smallest among all such solutions, then we show that we can find another solution \((u,v,w)\) with \(w\lt z\text{,}\) contradicting that \(z\) was the smallest integer appearing in a solution to \(x^4+y^4=z^4\text{.}\) This is quite difficult and wouldn't be expected of you on a homework or exam, it's just a bit of fun.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Explain why it suffices to only find positive solutions?</p></li>
<li><p>Why does it suffice to show \(x^4+y^4=z^2\) has no nontrivial integer solutions?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose there is a non-trivial solution positive solution to \(x^4 + y^4 = z^2\text{.}\) Then there is a solution \((x,y,z)\) with smallest \(z&gt;0\) among all solutions. Show that \(x,y,z\) have no common factors.</p></li>
<li><p>Show that exactly one of \(x\) or \(y\) is odd. Now assume \(x\) is odd and \(y\) is even.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Note that \(a=x^2\) and \(b=y^2\) along with \(c=z\) form a Pythagorean triple, \(a\) is odd, and \(x,y,z\) are coprime. Hence, by our work on classifying Pythagorean triples, we must have</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
(a,b,c) = \left( as^2 t^2, a\frac{s^2-t^2}{2}, a\frac{s^{2}+t^{2}}{2}\right)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">for some \(s&gt;t\text{.}\) Show that \(4\) divides \(s-t\text{.}\)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Using that \((s-t)(s+t)=2b=2y^2\text{,}\) show that there are integers \(u\) and \(v\) with \(s+t = 2u^2\) and \(s-t=4v^2\text{,}\) and \(u\) and \(2v\) are relatively prime. solving for \(s\) and \(t\text{,}\) verify that \(x^2+4v^4 = u^4\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Let \(A = x\text{,}\) \(B = 2v^2\) and \(C = u^2\text{.}\) Show that this is another Pythagorean triple of the form described in the parametrization theorem. So they can be expressed as above for \((a,b,c)\text{,}\) but with parameters \(S\) and \(T\) instead of \(s\) and \(t\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Arguing in a similar fashion to (d), show that \(S\) and \(T\) satisfy \(S+T = 2X^2\) and \(S-T=2Y^2\) for some positive integers\(X\) and \(Y\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Solve for \(S\) and \(T\) and verify that \(u^2 = X^4 + Y^4\text{.}\) Finally show that \(uXY\neq 0\) and that \(0 \lt u \lt z\text{,}\) leading to a contradiction.</p></li>
