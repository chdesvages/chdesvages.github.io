<body><article class="example example-like"><p>\item Equality is an equivalence relation. We also showed last week that \(\equiv \mod m\) is an equivalence relation. \item \(\leq\) is reflexive and transitive but not symmetric (\(1\leq 2\) but \(2\not\leq 1\)). \item The daughter-of relation \(\sim\) is not symmetric: if \(a\) is the daughter of \(b\text{,}\) then \(b\) is certainly not the daughter of \(a\text{,}\) and it is certainly not reflexive since no one is the daughter of themselves. Also,and the daughter-of relation is not transitive (if \(a\) is the daughter of \(b\) and \(b\) is the daughter of \(c\text{,}\) that does not mean \(a\) is the daughter of \(c\)).</p></article></body>
