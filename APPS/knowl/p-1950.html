<p>Suppose first that we treat each letter as an individual letter, that is, we look at the number of rearrangements of the word “\(ba_{1}n_{1}a_{2}n_{2}a_{3}\)”. There are now 6 distinct characters, so there are a total of \(6!\) ways of rearranging this word. This isn't the same thing as counting the number of ways of rearranging “banana”, since if we change the \(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3}\) in a rearrangement back into a's and the \(n_{1}\) and \(n_{2}\) back into n's, there are multiple ways of getting the same rearrangement of “banana.” For example, “nanaba” can be obtained from “\(n_{1}a_{1}n_{2}a_{3}ba_{2}\)” as well as “\(n_{2}a_{2}n_{1}a_{3}ba_{1}\text{.}\)” However, to each arrangement of “banana,” there are \(3!\) ways of treating the a's as distinct letters and \(2!\) ways of treating the n's as distinct letters so that they return the same rearrangement, and hence there are \(3!\cdot 2!\) rearrangements of “\(ba_{1}n_{1}a_{2}n_{2}a_{3}\)” that correspond to the same rearrangement of “banana” when we turn the \(n_i\)'s into \(n\)'s and the \(a_i\)'s into 'a's. Thus, counting the number of rearrangements of “\(ba_{1}n_{1}a_{2}n_{2}a_{3}\)” (which is \(6!\)) overcounts the number of rearrangements of “banana” by a factor of \(3!\cdot 2!\text{.}\) Hence, we just need to divide \(6!\) by \(3!\cdot 2!\) to get the number of rearrangements of “banana,” which is</p>
