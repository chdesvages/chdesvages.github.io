<p>Let \(f:X\rightarrow Y\) and \(g:Y\rightarrow Z\) be functions.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Suppose \(f\) and \(g\) are injective. To show that \(g\circ f\) is injective, we need to show that if \(g\circ f(x)=g\circ f(y)\text{,}\) then \(x=y\text{.}\) So suppose \(x,y\in X\) are so that \(g\circ f(x)=g\circ f(y)\text{.}\) Then \(g(f(x))=g(f(y))\text{.}\) Since \(g\) is injective, this means \(f(x)=f(y)\text{;}\) since \(f\) is injective, this implies \(x=y\text{,}\) as desired. This completes the proof that \(g\circ f\) is injective.</p></li>
<li><p>Now suppose \(f\) and \(g\) are surjective. To show that \(g\circ f\) is surjective, we need to show that for all \(z\in Z\text{,}\) there is \(x\in X\) so that \(z=g\circ f(x)=g(f(x))\text{.}\) Since \(g\) is surjective, there is \(y\in Y\) so that \(z=g(y)\text{;}\) since \(f\) is surjective, there is \(x\in X\) so that \(f(x)=y\text{,}\) and so \(g(f(x))=g(y)=z\text{,}\) as desired. This finishes the proof that \(g\circ f\) is surjective.</p></li>
<li><p>If \(g\) and \(f\) are bijective, then they are both injective and surjective, so by the previous two cases, \(g\circ f\) is also both injective and surjective, hence \(g\circ f\) is bijective.</p></li>
