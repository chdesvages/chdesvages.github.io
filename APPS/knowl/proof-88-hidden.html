<p>If \(n=1\text{,}\) then \(P\) is a process of one stage where there are just \(a_{1}\) choices, and so there are only \(a_{1}\) many outcomes. This proves the base case.</p>

<p>Suppose \(P(n)\) is true for some \(n\in \mathbb{N}\text{.}\) Suppose now \(P\) is a process with \(n+1\) stages and the \(i\)th stage has \(a_{i}\) choices. Note that if we stop the process before the last stage, we will have performed a process with \(n\) stages and for each \(i=1, \dots ,n\text{,}\) there are \(a_{i}\) choices. Then the induction hypothesis implies that there are \(a_{1}\cdots a_{n}\) outcomes. However, for each outcome of the first \(n\) stages, there are now \(a_{n+1}\) choices we can make. So the total number of outcomes after the \(n+1\) stage is the total number of outcomes after \(n\) steps times the total number of outcomes that can happen from each of those outcomes, that is \((a_{1}\cdots a_{n})\cdot a_{n+1}\text{.}\) This proves \(P(n+1)\) and finishes the proof.</p>
