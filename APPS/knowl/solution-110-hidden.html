<p>Let \(x \in \mathbb{R}\text{.}\) If \(x \in \mathbb{Z}\) we simply take \(a_0 = x\) and we are finished. So assume \(x \notin \mathbb{Z}\text{.}\) Let \(A= \{ n \in \mathbb{Z} \; | \; n &gt; x\}\text{.}\) Then \(A \neq \emptyset\) by the Archimedean property, and \(x\) is a lower bound for \(A\text{.}\) Then \(A\) has a minimum member \(n_0\text{.}\) Therefore \(x \lt n_0\) and \(n_0 - 1 \leq x\text{.}\) Take \(a_0 = n_0 -1\text{.}\) (Note that this argument works if and only if we are in the setting of an ordered field with the Archimedean property.) The uniqueness of \(a_0\) is easy.</p>
<p>(The fact that \(A\) actually has a minimum member deserves more discussion. \(A\) is nonempty and has some lower bound. By the Archimedean property we can assert that it has a lower bound in \(\mathbb{Z}\text{.}\) The well-ordering principle — which states that a nonempty subset of \(\mathbb{N}\) has a least member, and which follows from the principle of induction — allows us to conclude that the minimum exists.)</p>
<p>For the second assertion, let \(a_{0}\) be the integer part of \(x\text{.}\) Then \(a_{0}\leq x\lt a_{0}+1\text{.}\) So \(x\in [a_{0},a_{0}+1)\text{,}\) i.e. \(x - a_0 \in [0,1)\text{.}\) Now apply <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/decimal_existence.html" title="Theorem 9.1.2">Theorem 9.1.2</a> to \(x - a_0\text{.}\)</p>
