<p>Consider the relation on people that \(a\sim b\) if \(a\) and \(b\) were born in the same country. One can check this is an equivalence relation. What if we want to describe the equivalence classes? We could just say “they are the sets \(\cl(x)\) where \(x\) ranges over all people” but this is not helpful in general; this says no more about the relation or what the classes look like than making the same statement about any other relation. A more natural way of describing the equivalence classes is that they are just the sets of people born in a given country, that is, they are the sets \(A_x\) of people born in country \(x\) as \(x\) ranges over all countries.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="equivalencerels.html#example-46">in-context</a></span>
