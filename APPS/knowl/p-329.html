<p><em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">Why care?</em> Relations and equivalence relations come about when there is a collection of objects and you would like to treat many of them as really the same object. Take for example the rational numbers \(\mathbb{Q}\text{,}\) these are the sets of fractions \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\in\mathbb{Z}\) and \(q\in \mathbb{N}\text{.}\) But notice that the notation \(\frac{p}{q}\) is really just an ordered pair, we could have also just written \((p,q)\text{.}\) But we know that several fractions should give the same number, that is \(\frac{2}{1}=\frac{4}{2}\text{.}\) Really what we're doing here is defining an equivalence relation “=” by saying \(\frac{p}{q}=\frac{r}{s}\) if there is an integer \(a\) so that either \((p,q)=(ar,as)\) or \((r,s)=(ap,aq)\text{.}\) We will also see in the next chapter that functions are also relations. You'll see more important examples in future classes.</p>
