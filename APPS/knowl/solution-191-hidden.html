<p>By looking at the cycle notation for a permutation \(f\in S_{6}\text{,}\) the only way it can have order \(3\) is if it is either a \(3\)-cycle or a product of two disjoint \(3\)-cycles. As in one of the previous exercises, there are \({6\choose 3}\cdot 2\) \(3\)-cycles. To count disjoint products of \(3\)-cycles, notice that for each \(3\)-cycle \(p\) there are \((3-1)!=2\) \(3\)-cycles \(q\) we can have on the remaining \(3\) numbers in \(\{1,...,6\}\) not appearing in \(p\text{.}\) If we count them in this way though, each product of two disjoint \(3\)-cycles is counted twice (once as \(pq\) and then as \(qp\)), so we have to divide our answer by \(2\text{,}\) so the number of products of disjoint \(3\) cycles is</p>
