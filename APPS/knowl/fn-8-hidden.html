<body><div class="fn">Paul Erd≈ës was one of the greatest combinatorists in history, and the most prolific mathematician, publishing at least 1,525 mathematical papers, more than any other mathematician (though Euler wrote more total pages). His life is incredibly interesting as well, as he spent a large part of it technically homeless, with no permanent address, just travelling and staying with other mathematicians. For a short summary, you can read here ({\url{http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Erdos.html}}), otherwise his biography <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">The Man Who Loved Only Numbers</dfn> is a great read.</div></body>
