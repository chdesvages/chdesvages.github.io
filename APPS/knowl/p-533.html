<p>How does a computer compute \(\sqrt{51}\text{?}\) A computer can't possibly memorise all possible square roots, so it must compute it from scratch. Moreover, it can't possibly compute the entire decimal expansion (next week we will see that, because \(\sqrt{51}\) is irrational, the decimal expansion never repeats), so it can only come up with an approximation. Thus, your computer requires an algorithm for computing \(\sqrt{51}\) (or any root) to any degree of accuracy. But before implementing such an algorithm, we need to <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">justify</dfn> that it can indeed approximate \(\sqrt{51}\) to any degree of accuracy. That is, if my algorithm spits out a sequence of numbers \(x_1,x_2,\dots\text{,}\) and we want an approximation that is within \(10^{-10}\) of \(\sqrt{51}\text{,}\) I need to show that for all large enough \(n\text{,}\) \(x_n\) is at most \(10^{-10}\) away from \(\sqrt{51}\text{,}\) and I need this to happen for <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">every</dfn> degree of accuracy \(\epsilon&gt;0\) that I may require (not just \(10^{-10}\)).</p>
