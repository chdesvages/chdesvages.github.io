<p>The axiom schema of set theory that allows us to define new sets in this way is called the <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">Axiom Schema of Bounded Comprehension</dfn>. It says that if you have any statement \(\phi(x)\) of set theory containing a free variable \(x\text{,}\) and if you have a set \(S\text{,}\) then you are entitled to form the set \(\{x \in S : \phi(x)\}\) whose elements are precisely those elements of \(S\) such that \(\phi(x)\) holds. The “boundedness” is the presence of the ambient set \(S\text{.}\) Bertrand Russell noticed that if you have an <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">Axiom Schema of Unbounded Replacement</dfn>, then you can generate contradictions: he suggested that we consider the set \(R = \{ S : S \notin S \} \text{,}\) which you'd have to allow if you have Unbounded Comprehension. The set \(R\) the set of all sets that are not elements of themselves. Is \(R\) an element of itself? If it isn't, then it is, and if it is, then it isn't! The solution is reject the possibility that \(R\) is a set, and along with it, you'll have to reject Unbounded Comprehension!</p>
