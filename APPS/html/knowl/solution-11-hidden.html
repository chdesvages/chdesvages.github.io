<p>We can form the composition of \(f \colon A \to B\) and \(g \colon C \to D\) if and only if \(B=C\text{.}\) In some of the above examples we have that \(B \subset C\text{.}\) In this case, although we can morally do the composition, in practice we would need to do the composition \(g \circ f' \circ f \colon A \to D\) where \(f' \colon B \to C\) is defined by \(f'(x)=x\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Therefore the valid compositions are</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>\(f_2 \circ f_1 \colon \R \to \Z\) defined by \(f_2 \circ f_1(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor + 1\text{.}\) This is not 1-1 since 1 and 1.5 have the same image. It is onto, because \(n-1\) maps to \(n\) for every \(n \in \Z\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>\(f_2 \circ f_2 \colon \Z \to\Z\) defined by \(f_2 \circ f_2(x) = x+2\text{.}\) It is both 1-1 and onto, so is a bijection. Its inverse is the function \(f'\colon \Z \to \Z\) defined by \(f'(x) = x-2\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>\(f_2 \circ f_3 \colon \Z \times \Z \to \Z\) defined by \(f_2 \circ f_3(x,y) = xy+1\text{.}\) Not 1-1, since \((1,1)\) and \((-1,-1)\) have the same image. It is onto, since \((x-1,1)\) maps to \(x\) for all \(x \in \Z\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>\(f_3 \circ f_4 \colon \R \to \Z\) defined by \(f_3 \circ f_4 (x) = \lfloor x \rfloor \lceil x \rceil\text{.}\) Not 1-1, since 0.1 and 0.2 have the same image. Not onto, because we can only get products of consecutive integers. So, for example, there is no \(x\) which maps to \(14 = 2 \times 7\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>\(f_6 \circ f_5 \colon \{1,\dots, 10\} \to \{1,\dots, 10\}\) defined by \(f_6 \circ f_5(x) = \begin{cases}10 \amp \text{ if } x \text{ is even } \\7 \amp \text{ if } x \text{ is odd } \end{cases}\text{.}\) This is not 1-1 since 2 and 4 have the same image. It is not onto because nothing maps to 1.</p></li>
<li><p>\(f_5 \circ f_6 \colon \{0,1\} \to \{0,1\}\) defined by \(f_5 \circ f_6(0) = 0\text{,}\) \(f_5 \circ f_6(1) = 1\text{.}\) This is both 1-1 and onto and is its own inverse function. (So just because \(f \circ g\) is bijective, doesn't mean \(g \circ f\) is bijective!)</p></li>
