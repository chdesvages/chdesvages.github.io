<body><article class="example example-like"><p>How many diagonals are there in a regular polygon with \(n \geq 3\) sides?</p>
<p>This was an exercise in the chapter on induction, but now we will give a different proof. A first attempt is as follows using the Multiplication Principle. Given two vertices \(v\) and \(w\text{,}\) we will let \(\overline{vw}\) denote the line segment between them. Pick a corner \(v\text{,}\) there are \(n\) options. Then there are \(n-3\) other corners \(w\) that you can pick to form a diagonal \(\overline{vw}\) (since we have to exclude the vertex \(v\) and the two vertices next to it, since connecting to those from \(v\) won't form a diagonal contained in the polygon). Thus, there are \(n(n-3)\) ways of picking a corner \(v\) and then another corner \(w\) so that \(\overline{vw}\) forms a diagonal.</p>
<p>However, this is <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">not</dfn> the final answer. Notice that in this algorithm, each diagonal actually gets counted twice, since for two nonadjacent corners \(v\) and \(w\text{,}\) \(\overline{vw}=\overline{wv}\text{.}\) What we have really counted is the number of ordered pairs \((v,w)\) of corners that are not adjacent, and every diagonal corresponds to exactly two such pairs. Thus, if we divide \(n(n-3)\) by two, we get the true number of diagonals, that is, \(n(n-3)/2\text{.}\) (And note that either \(n\) or \(n-3\) is even!)</p></article></body>
